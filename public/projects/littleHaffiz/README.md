# Little Hafiz

A comprehensive Quran memorization experience for kids and adults. The experience includes verse-by-verse listening, configurable repetition ranges, interactive memorization games, progress tracking, and parental controls—packaged as a Flutter web app that can also be wrapped for mobile.

## 📱 Live Preview
- **Desktop build:** open [`index.html`](./index.html) in any static server.
- **Phone mockup:** open [`mobile-view.html`](./mobile-view.html) to see the responsive layout embedded in a device frame (used by the main portfolio site).

## ✨ Features
1. Guided memorization journeys with granular surah/ayah selection.
2. Adjustable repetition counts plus auto-loop ranges to focus on tricky verses.
3. Gamified drills that surface previously memorized ayat for spaced reinforcement.
4. Progress tracking dashboard for learners and guardians.
5. Parental controls to lock specific lessons or set daily goals.
6. Installable PWA experience with offline caching via `flutter_service_worker.js`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Flutter 3 (Dart)
- **Target:** Flutter Web (can also ship to Android/iOS)
- **Rendering:** CanvasKit build (`canvaskit/` assets) for crisp typography and animations
- **PWA:** Generated manifest + service worker for installability and offline support

## ▶️ Running Locally
### Quick preview of the compiled build
```bash
# from public/projects/littleHaffiz
npx serve .
# or use any static server (python -m http.server, http-server, etc.)
```
Then visit the printed URL and open `/mobile-view.html` to match the portfolio showcase, or `/index.html` for the raw Flutter shell.

### Rebuilding from Flutter source
This folder contains the release artifacts only. To modify logic/UI:
1. Open the original Flutter project (not included here).
2. Update the code as needed.
3. Run `flutter build web --release --base-href /projects/littleHaffiz/`.
4. Replace the generated `build/web` output with the contents of this directory.

## 🚀 Deployment Tips
- These artifacts are static; deploy them to any CDN or static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc.).
- Ensure the base URL matches `/projects/littleHaffiz/` when serving within the main portfolio.
- Keep `flutter_service_worker.js` in sync with each build to avoid stale caches for returning users.
